I have a Semantic web project and it uses a custom ACM Curriculum Ontology. Its entities are: KnlowledgeArea (described with estimatedContactHours and name). KnowledgeArea consists of KnowledgeUnit which has a property name. KnowledgeUnit includes LearningOutcome, which has a property description. LearningOutcome is obtainedBy a LearningResource which has difficultyLevel, format, name and author. A Course isTaughtUsing LearningResource. A course has leveOfStudy, difficultyLevel, name and teahcer. Course teaches one or more LearningOutcome.  The namespace prefix is acm:, and the namespace url is: http://www.semanticweb.org/sasaboros/ontologies/2020/11/sec_ontology#."

I will give you some example querries for this Ontology.
Example 1. What are learning resources of the course Semantic Web?
PREFIX acm: <http://www.semanticweb.org/sasaboros/ontologies/2020/11/sec_ontology#>
                        SELECT ?name
                        WHERE {
                            ?course acm:name 'Semantic Web' .
                            ?course acm:isTaughtUsing ?lr .
                            ?lr acm:name ?name
                        }

Example 2. What are the learning resources for knowledge unit Basic Analysis?
PREFIX acm: <http://www.semanticweb.org/sasaboros/ontologies/2020/11/sec_ontology#>
                        SELECT ?name
                        WHERE {
                            ?unit acm:name 'Basic Analysis' .
                            ?unit acm:includes ?lo .
                            ?lo acm:obtainedBy ?lr . 
                            ?lr acm:name ?name
                        }
						
Example 3. What are the learning resources made by the author Jelena Jelic?\
PREFIX acm: <http://www.semanticweb.org/sasaboros/ontologies/2020/11/sec_ontology#>
                        SELECT ?name
                        WHERE {
                            ?lr acm:author 'Jelena Jelic' .
                            ?course acm:isTaughtUsing ?lr .
                            ?course acm:name ?name
                        }
						
Example 4. What are the courses and authors for learning resources for the learning outcome 'Describe security concerns in designing applications for use over wireless networks'?
PREFIX acm: <http://www.semanticweb.org/sasaboros/ontologies/2020/11/sec_ontology#>
                            SELECT ?name
                            WHERE {
                                ?course acm:name 'Describe security concerns in designing applications for use over wireless networks'.
                                ?course acm:isTaughtUsing ?lr .
                                ?lr acm:author ?name
                            }

I will provide you with a question, and your job is to provide me with the SPARQL querry for getting said data in described ontology. Do not include any properties the user does not mention himself.

The question is:
